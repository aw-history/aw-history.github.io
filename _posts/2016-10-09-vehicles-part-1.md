This post will be a dispassionate and scientific inquiry into which vehicles all those *other* dishonorable no-good stat-padding pubbies are driving.

The data is the same as the one used for classes: 64,903 individual player-match outcomes on both NA and EU, covering about 3000 PvP games. Almost all of the T8+ data is from NA and it's mostly 8v8, so keep that in mind. I'll use this to show which vehicles are being driven, by tier. Sample size is pretty small for tier 1 and 2 so I don't cover that, or arty. 

I've split this topic into two parts. The first covers vehicles being driven along with a general sense of their XP income, while the second covers vehicle performance. 

### <a name="all"></a>Vehicles - All players

[Vehicle table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ojW4-WiTihMSOan8D8tpqdnm7I24WAKUAY0_O4fW5iU/edit#gid=811163240)

I'll point out some of the more interesting things, by tier. 

### <a name="tier3"></a>Tier 3: T-62s and the XM800

This tier is pretty spread out. T-62s are most driven at 19%, with XM800s right behind at 15%. Most of the other line vehicles hover around 10%. 

The Scorpion and AMX-10P are lower at 5% and 6% respectively. 

The average XP income range for the entire tier is only 20%, with the XM800, LAV 50-90 and Dragoon at the top by a very small margin.

### <a name="tier4"></a>Tier 4: Camo snippery

As per the class post, TDs make up 25% of the vehicles. This is probably because they're good and there are three at this tier: Zhalos (9%), Pac90s (6%) and LAV 300s (10%).

The rest of tier is pretty well spread out, with most vehicles hovering around 6% of the total. The BMP-1P (4%) seems a little less popular than the Swingfire (7%) and BMD-1 (6%). In terms of MBTs, the T-64 comes in highest at 14%, followed by the OF-40 (10%), Starship (8%) and Type 69II (5%).

The XP spread is a little higher. Zhalos at the top (along with the other TDs and the BWP) bringing in 33% more XP, on average, than the OF-40 at the bottom. 

### <a name="tier5"></a>Tier 5: Award for 'Most Clippable MBT'

The most driven vehicles at tier 5 are the ERC-90 (16%), Chieftain (14%) and T-72 (13%) and then the Fox and Bagel at 10%. The WZ makes up 8% of the tier, the same as the M60A3. The Leo 1A5 is close behind at 7%. The BMP is again the least popular AFV at 5%, as compared to the BMD at 8%.

This tier has a 26% spread in XP income. The WZ-1224, ERC-90 and Fox are at the top for XP income and... better sit down for this: The Leo 1A5 at the bottom. I kinda like the Leo, but I don't think it'd be OP if the front hull bounced an AC round every now and then.

### <a name="tier6"></a>Tier 6: Pretty balanced, shoulda got a Founder's Pack

The Leo 2AV leads the pack, making up 13% of vehicles. The Centauro is next at 10%. This is a remarkably evenly driven tier and, along with some other stats, confirms the perception as this being one of the best balanced tiers (before 0.17). The XM1 seems to be the least popular of the MBTs at 5%, compared to the T-72A (9%) and MBT-70 (8%), for example.

Terminators lead in XP followed by VFMs, which also make up 3% and 9% of vehicles driven respectively. RDFs, Stingrays, BMP-3s and Centauros bring up the bottom of the XP income distribution.

### <a name="tier7"></a>Tier 7: Hmmm...

Here's where it starts to go bad. 

The Challenger 1 makes up 22% of all Tier 7 vehicles, followed by the Cent 120 at 15%. Take some time to change your pants, it's a shock. After that you get Wiesels at 11%. Challengers and Cents lead the XP board, with Wiesels close behind. Challengers also bring in the most average spot damage at the tier by quite a margin over the AFVs, not to mention everything else. More on this later.

The BMD-4 is driven more than twice as much as the BMP-3M (8% vs 3%). 

The T-80 comes in as second most popular MBT at 9% of vehicles. M1s and Leo 2s are 5% and 6% of vehicles. They also round out the bottom of the XP board, except for a very small number of M60-2000s and FSEDs right below. The stats for the patriot tanks are too small to get reliable results, but make sense. You should probably get a US citizenship if you can surive 5 games in a row in either.

The LAV-600 comes in at 5% of vehicles, 1/3 of the number of Cent 120s. There seems to be small minority of contrarians who claim this is a better TD than the Cent 120. They have elsewhere been referred to as the hipsters of AW. I might try to investigate this claim in a later post. Not the hipster part. That's accurate. 

### <a name="tier8"></a>Tier 8: Scientists call it 'The Ramka Zone'

This is about as you'd expect. The Ariete is top at 19% followed by the T-90 at 18%, the Leo 2A5 at 12% and the M1A1 at 11%. Anecdotally, the Leo % is much higher recently. It has recently improved in both gun handling and firing ATGMs on the move, the latter of which messes up Ariete faces pretty bad. 

The population seems reasonably sane, and has thus avoided driving the Ramka (5%) throughout most of the year, the recent and expensive RCR almost overtaking it as a % of vehicles driven. The Ramka is another tank that improved a lot in 0.17, and will likely get better next patch - after which 80% of your ATGMs shouldn't fire straight into space or the ground on slightly uneven terrain.

The M1128 (8%) and XM8 (7%) round out the bottom of the XP board. 

In a consistent trend at tier 7+, an MBT (the Leo 2A5) has the highest average spotting damage in the tier. 

### <a name="tier9"></a>Tier 9: Honestly, the MS just looks too good

The T90MS was the top vehicle driven at 28%, followed by the Leo 2A6 and Challenger 2 tied for second with 17%. 9% of the tier 9 population still hadn't learned their lesson and drove the M1A2. I actually don't know if it's good, I don't have it. On the other hand, the M1 line has won my Favourite Tanks to Fight award - 35 weeks running. 

The terminator is the smallest part of the tier 9 population at 4%, followed by the M8 (7%). The Crab and Draco are around 10%. You're kinda hurting for options if you don't like MBTs... although I have it on good authority that the M8 is magical. 

The Challenger 2 has hands-down the highest average spotting damage: 96% more than the CRAB, for example. 

### <a name="tier10"></a>Tier 10: All the MBTs are pretty decent here

The Armata is top of NA tier 10 at 30% of vehicles, followed by the Leo (19%), the XM1A3 (16%) and the Chally ATDU (10%). The PL is relatively popular at 16%, with the SPHINX trailing at 8%. The T15 only shows up as 1% of vehicles, probably because they're off hoarding PVE platinum crates.

Once again a Chally is the best spotter, bringing in 61% more average spotting damage than the SPHINX.
