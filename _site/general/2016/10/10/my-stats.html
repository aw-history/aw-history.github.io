<p>The first topic I’ll cover will be my stats. The purpose of this is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll have more info about how my match performance might be biasing the sample.</li>
  <li>You can get a sense of my experience with the game - 27% win rate is pretty good, right guys?</li>
  <li>To make sure I understand the data and can calculate things correctly - I can compare to my dossier in AW.</li>
</ol>

<!-- done -->

<p>Rather than just replicating the dossier, I’ll focus on things that are more interesting, and probably generally relevant. In all these posts I round values to be the same as the dossier.</p>

<p>I’ve played since the start of Open Beta with about 4600 pvp games on NA, of which only 2600 are included in this sample.</p>

<p>It’s too bad I don’t have the first 2000. AW is my first tank game and so those early stats would have been…. interesting. While I can’t prove it scientifically, I can assure you that the amount of shit you get in chat is HIGHLY correlated with your skill. Pffft whatever. You show me where on the Starship it’s written “not a camo sniper.”</p>

<p>All the following stats are for the observed sample, of course.</p>

<p>I have ~460 games on EU. The EU games were for science! Specifically, to collect data on a popular topic (Tier 7 MBT balance) that I’ll get to eventually. For those who can’t wait: It is bad.</p>

<p>I play PVE almost exclusively for tier 10 crew &amp; event grinding purposes. Usually for the x4+ reliability etc.</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>

<p>I filtered out the platoon games for consistency. Looks like I got better at the game. Nevertheless, like any good man of the pubbies I’m still quite capable of drowning myself or chasing a one-shot around a rock for 5 minutes while my team dies elsewhere.</p>

<p>I was acutally quite bad at MBTs until later on in this sample, which could explain why both the first and last games have decent stats but the overall is lower. There’s probably a dip in there.</p>

<p>I hope to get to what I think will be an interesting post on “the high-tier learning curve.”</p>

<p>Nothing too surprising. Damage per match increases as you go up tiers. That’s why that stat depends a lot on average tier. Additionally, lower tiers are easier than higher tiers and this is generally reflected in individual stats.</p>

<p>Vehicle class and competition is affecting KpM and K/D somewhat in T8+ (mostly MBTs), but W/R is the same as mid tiers.</p>

<p>Platooning seems to add a few percent to win rate. I find the game significantly easier in a (good) platoon, especially if you start taking more powerful vehicles. However, I think you’d need a lot of player data to properly investigate the impact of platooning. I probably don’t have enough games in a platoon to get decent estimates.</p>

<p>MBTs are overrepresented here because these games cover more of my high tier period. My dossier is about 40% MBTs, the rest split. Damage per match isn’t very interesting because it doesn’t control for tier.</p>

<p>The TD win rate is dominated by the Cent 120 and Taifun. However, as we’ll see in the next post, TDs generally have higher damage and K/D than other classes among the population generally, although not necessarily win rate.</p>

<p>MBT KpM is low, although again this seems like a general phenomenon in the population. MBTs, at least for me, are also most affected by tier differences.</p>

<p>Interestingly, win rate only seems to suffer once down two tiers. The other stats drop quite significantly, however. To no one’s surprise, you really eat shit when you’re two tiers down.</p>

<p>A source of bias here relative to EU is that for awhile now on NA, you’ve essentially been able to control the tier you play at. You can usually see the next game to pop. I don’t always play top, but I often choose vehicles that can compete against the top tier.</p>

<p>In another post I might use the EU sample to show MM tier impact for a more regular grind (e.g. going up a tank line). Sneak peak: You can get pretty fucked.</p>

<h3 id="a-namestreaksawinning-and-losing-streaks"><a name="streaks"></a>Winning and losing streaks</h3>

<p><img src="/img/winloss.png" alt="Winning and losing streaks" title="Winning and losing streaks" /></p>

<p>The distribution of winning and losing streaks looks like a bell curve (a Normal-ish distribution). It’s a bit hard to make out from the chart, but from the numbers it looks like winning streaks are more likely than losing streaks. This makes sense given my win rate is in the 56% range.</p>

<p>At a win rate of 50% I think this would likely be a Normal distribution -&gt; Winning streaks of a particular length are as likely as losing streaks of the same length. Longer streaks become increasingly unlikely.</p>

<p>Next, for fun, longest vehicle-specific winning and losing streaks. These aren’t necessarily games one after another.</p>

<p>This list would be fairly different if all games were included. For example, Taifun would be first at ~ 400 games, T-80 second ~ 240.</p>

<p>Across 4600 PVP games I’ve played most tanks to a reasonable degree. I don’t have any of the skinned tanks, the new CE tanks, the VFM, most of the new premiums, the Tier 9 Leo or T9/10 M1, the T7+ Chinese tanks, the T-15 or most of the arty.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to eventually do a post on how many games you need to get a vehicle win rate that reasonably reflects your skill level.</p>

<p>In the meantime I’ll use my judgement about “the run” I’ve had in a vehicle combined with its other stats if I use a vehicle W/R as part of an analysis. Kills per match and damage are the big ones.</p>

<p>For example, here I’d say the XM800 and Taifun are too high by about 5% or so. Good stats in each, but not enough to justify high 60s.</p>

<p>Taking out the 21 game Taifun winning streak (described above) and working back, the other 122 games had a W/R of ~62%, which is more reasonable for its stats. About the same with the XM800.</p>

<p>ATDU could probably come down to mid-ish 50s and I think you could take a few % off the 90MS.</p>

<p>In terms of the bottom W/Rs, 2A5 is a little low. The BMD-4 is also likely too low. My dossier is ~56% at 130 games or so. OTOH, I think the smaller NA games are harder on the light vehicles, so perhaps not. LAV 600 is also probably a few % too low, but not by much. It’s outmatched in 8v8.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Pretty standard stuff but I think it’s interesting to put some actual numbers to these things.</p>
